# Multiplexing-using-7Seg-0-to-20-Common-Anode
In this project I'm using same pins of microcontroller to control two 7Segments (switching between two 7segments very quickly in a frequency that eye of human can't notice that one of 7 segments is turned on and the other is turned off) to display numbers from 0 second to 20 seconds, again from 0 second to 20 seconds and so on.

## Devices used:

-Atmega32 (where we put our code to do specific functions)

-7Segments (for displaying numbers)
## tools used:

-Proteus 8 Professional

-Atmel Studio 6.0

## note:
-using same pins to control more than a 7Segments is an advantage because we can use same pins for controlling six 7Segments if we want to build Real Time Clock (RTC) project.

-there is a video provided in code folder
